# Microsoft 365 Security & Compliance Implementation

This repository documents my hands-on experience configuring and managing core Microsoft 365 security and compliance features. The goal was to secure a remote-first organization using Microsoft 365 E5 tools, while aligning with data protection and cybersecurity best practices (e.g., ISO 27001, NDPR, and NCA).

## 📋 Policies & Governance

In addition to technical configurations, I developed key organizational security policies aligned with ISO 27001 and NCA controls:

- Acceptable use policy
- Clear desk clear screen policy

These policies support baseline security hygiene, reduce insider threats, and reinforce staff accountability.

## 📢 Awareness Training Materials

I created security awareness training materials to educate users on current threats and promote secure habits:

- Ransomware Awareness

The training supports behavioral change and aligns with ISO 27001 A.6.3 (Awareness, Education & Training).
